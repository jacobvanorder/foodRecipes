## Ingredients ##

6 quarts water (divided)
1 whole chicken
2 white onions
2-3 scallions
2 shallots
1 carrot
3-4 cloves garlic
Salt
Freshly ground pepper
Soy sauce
Sesame Oil
Noodles of your choice (udon, fettuccine, egg, etc.)
Garnishes of your choice (chopped scallions, hard-cooked egg, bamboo shoots, sliced mushrooms, etc.)

## Instructions

* Fill each pot halfway (4 qts water in 8 qt pot, 2 qts water in 4 qt pot). Put them on stove over a med-high heat.
* Disjoint the chicken and salt it liberally, working the salt into the meat.
* Put the chicken pieces (including the giblets) into the large pot of heating water.
* Coarsely grind some fresh black pepper into the pot (6-8 grinds)
* Peel and cut the onions and shallots in half.
* Cut the scallions and carrot into 4-inch lengths.
* Put onions, shallots, scallions, carrot, and garlic into the smaller pot of heating water.

Cook the broths

* Bring both pots to a simmer and turn down the heat. Let them simmer for one hour.
* After one hour, pull the chicken breasts, legs, and thighs from the pot. Let them cool; pick the meat off the bones and reserve. * Return the bones, skin, and gristle to the large pot.
* Bring both pots to a slow, gentle boil and let them cook for two hours, uncovered. (This is the “cook the shit” out of them portion* .)
* After two hours, the volume should have been reduced to about half.
* Strain the vegetable broth, discard the veg, and return the broth to the smaller pot.
* Strain the chicken broth, discard the bones, skin, etc. De-fat the broth and return the broth to the larger pot.

Plating

* For each serving, prepare a bowl as follows:
* Break the chicken meat into bite-sized pieces and put a serving in the bottom of the bowl.
* Add 2 tbsp of soy sauce (see Notes, below).
* Add 1/2 tsp of sesame oil
* Add some of the garnish elements (chopped scallions and sliced mushrooms are good here)

Final assembly

* Bring the chicken broth to a boil and cook your noodles in the broth, according to specifications for your choice.
* Strain into a bowl to separate cooked noodles and broth.
* Add a serving of noodles to each bowl.
* Add 1 and 1/2 cup chicken broth to each bowl (see Notes, below).
* Add 1/4 cup vegetable broth to each bowl.
* Place final garnishes on top of noodles.

### Notes

I recommend starting with a 6:1 chicken:vegetable stock ratio, but you can adjust this to your preference.
Play with the amounts of soy sauce and sesame oil for each serving, also. I would not recommend going higher than 2 tbsp soy per bowl, but play with it and see how you like it.
For extra flavor, add a spoonful of warm chicken fat (reserved from the broth de-fatting step) to the final assembly.
